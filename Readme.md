MVC2 team builder version 2.0 

This will be the updated version of my first capstone with new features and layout.

IDEA 
Marvel vs capcom 2 is one of the greatest fighting game of all time helping push many tournements like EVO to a bigger spot in the early 2000's. the hype around it made me want to play and see what it is all about. The game is now more played on emulaters since they haven't sold it since the early 360 days bringing the problem of controls and character inputs being a chore to find for new players. My project is make it where you can find you inputs quick and easy while also finding out more about the game.

FEATURES
The main feature is the team builder where you chose your three team members out of the roaster of 56 character then while choosing the charcter will show up in the team section showing the inputs for your characters with the option of deleteing a member or (NEW) saving your team and naming it allowing you to go back to the teams if you like practicing with more then one team and switching it up. next to store your team I will be adding a new log in option so a user account and of course server will be added. The last new feature will be a the tier lists for characters in the game aswell as the fan made ratio mode to look at if interest in trying.
